# annonex2embl
### (future title: NEX2Webin)
Converts an annotated DNA sequence alignment in NEXUS format to either 
(a) TSV spreadsheets for submission to [ENA] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) via [Webin] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home) checklist submissions, or
(b) ENA flat files for submission via Webin Entry Upload submissions, if no suitable checklist is available).

#### CHANGELOG:
###### Version 0.2 (2017.01.22)
* Leading and trailing ambiguities per sequence are removed while maintaining correct annotations.
* Modifiers without content are no longer included in the output.
* Specification of taxonomic division and sequence version has been implemented.
* A submission mode that masks the ID line and the AC line has been implemented.
###### Version 0.3 (2017.01.25)
* Rudimentary checklist output has been implemented.
* Taxon names are compared to [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) and converted to informal names if not listed there.
###### Version 0.4 (2017.02.01)
* All qualifier values are formatted to consist of ASCII characters only.
* If a coding region is among the sequence features, the qualifier /\trans_table/ is added to the source feature.
* Implementation of customization of DE line.
